If you're looking to build a sleek, modern documentation site or blog, combining Nextra with Tailwind CSS and shadcn can offer a powerful and efficient solution. In this article, we'll walk through the steps to set up your project using these tools.

## Recommended way

import Link from "next/link";

<Button variant="outline" asChild>
    <Link href="https://github.com/ObservedObserver/nextra-docs-tailwind-shadcn-template" className="gap-2">
        <GitHubLogoIcon />
        <span>View on Github</span>
    </Link>
</Button>
<Button asChild>
    <Link href="https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FObservedObserver%2Fnextra-docs-tailwind-shadcn-template" className="gap-2">
        <VercelLogoIcon />

</Button>

## What is Nextra?

Nextra is a Next.js-based static site generator that's perfect for creating documentation sites. It provides a simple and flexible way to manage content with markdown files and supports features like syntax highlighting, custom themes, and more.

## Why Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to build custom designs without writing CSS from scratch. Its component-based approach and extensive customization options make it a popular choice for modern web development.

## Introduction to shadcn

shadcn is a simple and customizable component library that pairs well with Tailwind CSS. It provides a set of pre-designed components that you can easily integrate into your project, helping you maintain consistency and speed up development.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Set Up a New Next.js Project

First, create a new Next.js project if you haven't already:

```bash
npx create-next-app nextra-tailwind-shadcn
cd nextra-tailwind-shadcn
```

### Step 2: Install Nextra

Add Nextra to your project by installing it as a dependency:

```bash
npm install nextra
```

Then, update your `next.config.js` to use Nextra:

```js
// next.config.js
const withNextra = require('nextra')('nextra-theme-docs', './theme.config.js');
module.exports = withNextra();
```

### Step 3: Install Tailwind CSS

Follow the Tailwind CSS installation steps:

1. Install Tailwind CSS and its dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   ```

2. Create your `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`:

   ```bash
   npx tailwindcss init -p
   ```

3. Configure your template paths in `tailwind.config.js`:

   ```js
   // tailwind.config.js
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}',
       './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   };
   ```

4. Include Tailwind in your CSS:

   ```css
   /* styles/globals.css */
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

### Step 4: Add shadcn Components

Install shadcn:

```bash
npm install shadcn
```

You can now import and use shadcn components in your pages or components. For example:

```jsx
import { Button } from 'shadcn';

const MyButton = () => <Button>Click me!</Button>;

export default MyButton;
```

### Step 5: Customize Your Theme

Nextra allows you to customize the theme by editing `theme.config.js`. Here, you can define your site's title, logo, and other configurations.

```js
// theme.config.js
module.exports = {
  projectLink: 'https://github.com/your-repo',
  docsRepositoryBase: 'https://github.com/your-repo/docs',
  titleSuffix: ' â€“ Your Site',
  logo: <span>Your Logo</span>,
  // more configurations...
};
```

### Step 6: Start Your Development Server

Run your development server to see your changes:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see your Nextra site with Tailwind CSS and shadcn components in action.

## Conclusion

By combining Nextra, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn, you can create a highly customizable and modern documentation site or blog. Each tool brings unique strengths, making this stack an excellent choice for developers looking to build fast and stylish web applications. Enjoy building your next project with this powerful setup!
